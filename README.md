## About Me
Xin Chào! 안녕하세요! My name is Truc (Rachel), a graduating senior with a major in Business and a minor in Artificial Intelligence. As a first-generation student, I cultivated a proactive and results-driven mindset, which I've applied to my passion for building data-informed products and communities.

My core belief is that the best solutions are built on a deep understanding of data. I put this into practice by co-founding two organizations dedicated to supporting underrepresented communities. My data-centric approach led to significant, measurable success:

- Achieved 200% organic growth across platforms with a $0 marketing budget.

- Grew a professional LinkedIn community from 0 to 500+ followers.

- Cultivated an online group from scratch to over 10,000 engaged members.

- Successfully raising funds of 5M KRW.

- Took classes in two non-native languages, took on extra elective courses with Korean students, and got a cumulative GPA of 4.0.

- The first Vietnamese students in Yonsei Business Department to get nominated for a Business Competition in the US.

My problem-solving process always starts with data. Faced with the challenge of connecting students with startup internships, I identified the need for a scalable outreach plan. Despite having no prior experience, I quickly learned Python to scrape contact information from a public database, successfully creating the foundation for our partnership program. This data-first mentality extends to my personal organization, where I maintain a 4.0 GPA supported by a comprehensive life-database I built in Notion.

I am eager to apply my unique blend of business acumen, technical curiosity, and passion for metrics to a role where I can help deliver AI-powered solutions to millions of users.

Now,
